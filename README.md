# Longest Possible Word For A 7 Segment Digital Display
Originating from [Tom Scott's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4BMR88260) about the longest word that can be written using a 7 segment digital display.

There are of course some exceptions to letters that can or can't be used, the logical list is <kbd>g</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>m</kbd>, <kbd>q</kbd>, <kbd>v</kbd>, <kbd>w</kbd>, <kbd>x</kbd> and <kbd>z</kbd> with some added by Tom Scott for the sake of his video <kbd>i</kbd> and <kbd>o</kbd>.

This repo contains versions of the longest word retriever in several languages and as compressed as possible with the original code existing in the `original` directory.
